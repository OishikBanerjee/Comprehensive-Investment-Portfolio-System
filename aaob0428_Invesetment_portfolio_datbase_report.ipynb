        "\n",
        "## 2. Data Description\n",
        "### 2.1 Database Schema\n",
        "The database consists of the following tables:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Client: Stores investor details.\n",
        "- Portfolio: Manages different investment portfolios for clients.\n",
        "- InvestmentType: Defines various types of investments.\n",
        "- Investment: Records individual investment transactions.\n",
        "- Stock: Tracks stock holdings within portfolios.\n",

        "- **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Ensures atomic values (no repeating columns).\n",
        "- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Eliminates partial dependencies.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Identify the top-performing investments across all portfolios.\n",
        "2. Identify clients whose investment choices don't align with their risk profile.\n",
        "3. Analyze which stocks are performing best and worst in the portfolios.\n",
        "4. Evaluate how well portfolios are diversified across different investment types.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Observations\n",
        "- No multi-valued attributes, ensuring atomicity.\n",
        "- All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.\n",
        "- No transitive dependencies; foreign keys handle relationships.\n",
        "- The database is well-normalized, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.\n",
        "- The database supports efficient investment tracking and analysis.\n",
        "- Proper indexing significantly improves query performance.\n",
        "- Normalization reduces data redundancy, ensuring data consistency.\n",
        "-  The database performed efficiently with large datasets and concurrent transactions.\n",
        "- Stress testing confirmed the database's robustness under high transaction volumes.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. Managerial Insights\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Identifying Top-Performing Investments\n",
        "- Investments with the highest return percentage should be prioritized for further capital infusion.\n",
        "- Analyzing trends in high-performing investments can inform future portfolio allocations.\n",
        "- Consistently top-performing investment types should be considered for long-term strategic investments.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Aligning Investments with Client Risk Profiles\n",
        "- Clients with a low-risk profile investing over 30% in high-risk instruments indicate potential misalignment.\n",
        "- High-risk profile clients with less than 40% in high-risk investments may not be maximizing their return potential.\n",
        "- Tailored advisory strategies should be introduced to align investments with client risk tolerance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Best and Worst Performing Stocks\n",
        "- Stocks with consistently high return percentages should be recommended for portfolio expansion.\n",
        "- Stocks with persistently negative returns should be reviewed for potential divestment.\n",
        "- The correlation between stock occurrence count and returns should be analyzed to identify popular but underperforming stocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Portfolio Diversification Analysis\n",
        "- Portfolios with fewer than 3 distinct investment types may lack diversification and require rebalancing.\n",
        "- Portfolios dominated by a single investment type should be reviewed for risk exposure.\n",
        "- Clients with broad diversification tend to have lower volatility, reinforcing diversification as a risk mitigation strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Investment Strategy by Age Group\n",
        "- Clients under 30 have a higher inclination toward high-risk investments, indicating aggressive growth strategies.\n",
        "- Clients aged 51-60 hold the highest percentage of low-risk investments, emphasizing capital preservation strategies.\n",
        "- Middle-aged clients (30-50) show a balanced investment approach, requiring tailored financial planning services.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Investment Timing and Performance\n",
        "- Investments made in Q1 and Q4 exhibit better returns, suggesting seasonal trends in investment performance.\n",
        "- Months with high investment volume but low returns indicate suboptimal entry timing.\n",
        "- Identifying the best-performing months historically can inform better investment timing strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. Impact of Buy and Sell Transactions on Portfolio Performance\n",
        "- A high percentage of profitable sell transactions indicates strong investment timing strategies.\n",
        "- Buy transactions leading to consistent negative returns suggest a need for improved stock screening.\n",
        "- Analyzing sell transaction patterns can reveal profit-taking strategies and optimal exit points.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 8. Market Trends Analysis Over Time\n",
        "- Investment types with stable closing prices over multiple quarters suggest lower volatility and safer investments.\n",
        "- High quarter-over-quarter price fluctuations indicate speculative investment opportunities.\n",
        "- The relationship between market trends and client investment behavior should be analyzed for predictive insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 9. Popular Mutual Funds Among Risk Profiles\n",
        "- Low-risk profile clients tend to invest in mutual funds with high stability and dividends.\n",
        "- High-risk profile clients are more inclined towards growth-oriented mutual funds with volatile returns.\n",
        "- Understanding fund popularity by risk profile can aid in designing targeted financial products.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 10. High-Risk Exposure in Portfolios\n",
        "- Portfolios with excessive exposure to high-risk investments should be flagged for advisory intervention.\n",
        "- Portfolios heavily reliant on a single high-risk asset class are prone to significant volatility.\n",
        "- Diversification into medium and low-risk categories can enhance portfolio stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 11. Client Investment Behavior Analysis\n",
        "- Clients with consistent investment patterns are more predictable and require less frequent advisory adjustments.\n",
        "- Clients with erratic investment behavior may need active portfolio management services.\n",
        "- Investment preferences should be correlated with demographic factors for better client segmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 12. Sector-Specific Investment Performance\n",
        "- Certain sectors consistently outperform others, indicating potential for sector-focused funds.\n",
        "- Underperforming sectors should be monitored for exit strategies or restructuring.\n",
        "- Industry cycles should be mapped to investment performance to optimize timing.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 13. Investment Holding Period vs. Return Analysis\n",
        "- Investments held for over five years tend to generate higher annualized returns.\n",
        "- Short-term holdings exhibit more volatility, aligning with speculative trading behavior.\n",
        "- Clients should be advised on the benefits of long-term holding for wealth accumulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 14. Correlation Between Investment Type and Client Income Level\n",
        "- Higher-income clients prefer diversified portfolios with a mix of equity and debt instruments.\n",
        "- Middle-income clients show a preference for mutual funds and SIPs for steady returns.\n",
        "- Lower-income clients focus more on fixed-income instruments, suggesting a need for secure investment options.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 15. Stock Price Volatility Impact on Investment Behavior\n",
        "- Clients tend to reduce investments in highly volatile stocks, indicating risk aversion.\n",
        "- High-volatility stocks should be monitored for potential regulatory interventions.\n",
        "- Providing volatility-adjusted return metrics can help clients make more informed investment decisions.\n",
