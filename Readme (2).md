## 3. Querying and Data Retrieval
The system supports various SQL queries for financial analysis:

### Identify the top-performing investments across all portfolios
```sql
SELECT
    c.ClientID,
    c.Name,
    c.RiskProfile,
    COUNT(p.PortfolioID) AS NumberOfPortfolios,
    SUM(p.TotalValue) AS TotalInvestmentValue
FROM
    Client c
JOIN
    Portfolio p ON c.ClientID = p.ClientID
GROUP BY
    c.ClientID, c.Name, c.RiskProfile
ORDER BY
    TotalInvestmentValue DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Analyze investment strategies by client age groups
```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, c.DateOfBirth, CURDATE()) < 30 THEN 'Under 30'
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, c.DateOfBirth, CURDATE()) BETWEEN 30 AND 40 THEN '30-40'
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, c.DateOfBirth, CURDATE()) BETWEEN 41 AND 50 THEN '41-50'
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, c.DateOfBirth, CURDATE()) BETWEEN 51 AND 60 THEN '51-60'
        ELSE 'Over 60'
    END AS AgeGroup,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.ClientID) AS NumberOfClients,
    AVG(p.TotalValue) AS AveragePortfolioValue,
    SUM(p.TotalValue) AS TotalValue
FROM
    Client c
JOIN
    Portfolio p ON c.ClientID = p.ClientID
GROUP BY
    AgeGroup
ORDER BY
    AgeGroup;
```

### Correlation between investment timing and performance
```sql
SELECT
    YEAR(i.PurchaseDate) AS Year,
    MONTH(i.PurchaseDate) AS Month,
    COUNT(i.InvestmentID) AS NumberOfInvestments,
    SUM(i.AmountInvested) AS TotalInvested,
    SUM(i.CurrentValue) AS CurrentValue,
    ROUND((SUM(i.CurrentValue) - SUM(i.AmountInvested)) / SUM(i.AmountInvested) * 100, 2) AS ReturnPercentage
FROM
    Investment i
WHERE
    i.PurchaseDate IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    YEAR(i.PurchaseDate), MONTH(i.PurchaseDate)
ORDER BY
    Year, Month;
```

## 4. Normal Form Testing
- **1NF**: Ensures atomic values (no repeating columns).
- **2NF**: Eliminates partial dependencies.
- **3NF**: Eliminates transitive dependencies.

---

## 5. Stress Testing
- **Load Testing**: Evaluated query performance under heavy loads.
- **Index Optimization**: Applied indexes for efficiency.
- **Concurrency Testing**: Ensured multiple users can retrieve data without bottlenecks.

## 7. Managerial Insights

### 1. Identifying Top-Performing Investments
- Prioritize high-return investments for further capital infusion.
- Track trends in top investments to optimize future allocations.
- Focus on consistently top-performing investment types for strategy.

### 2. Aligning Investments with Client Risk Profiles
- Clients misaligned with their risk profile require advisory intervention.
- High-risk clients with low-risk portfolios may be underutilizing opportunities.

### 3. Best and Worst Performing Stocks
- High-return stocks should be expanded in portfolios.
- Persistently negative return stocks require review or divestment.
- Analyze stock popularity vs. returns to identify risky trends.

### 4. Portfolio Diversification Analysis
- Portfolios with <3 investment types indicate poor diversification.
- Overexposure to a single type increases risk exposure.

### 5. Investment Strategy by Age Group
- Under 30 investors favor high-risk investments.
- 51-60 age group prioritizes capital preservation.

### 6. Investment Timing and Performance
- Q1 & Q4 investments show better returns.
- High investment volume but low returns indicate poor timing.

### 7. Impact of Buy and Sell Transactions on Portfolio Performance
- High-profit sell transactions reflect strong timing strategies.
- Negative returns on buys suggest poor stock screening.

### 8. Market Trends Analysis Over Time
- Stable investments are safer, while volatile investments show speculative trends.
